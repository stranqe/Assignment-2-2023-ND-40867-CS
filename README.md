Introduction

The rise of social media has transformed how individuals communicate and interact. While social media platforms offer opportunities for connection and expression, there is growing concern about their effects on mental health. This paper explores the dual nature of social media's impact, examining both its potential benefits and drawbacks.

Literature Review

Several studies highlight the relationship between social media use and mental health outcomes. According to Twenge et al. (2019), increased social media usage correlates with higher rates of depression among adolescents. They argue that the constant comparison facilitated by these platforms can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem.

Conversely, a government report by the National Institutes of Health (2020) suggests that social media can provide support networks for individuals experiencing mental health issues. These platforms can foster community and reduce feelings of isolation, particularly for marginalized groups.

Furthermore, a peer-reviewed article by Primack et al. (2017) discusses the complexity of social media's impact, indicating that the nature of interactions—whether positive or negative—plays a crucial role in determining mental health outcomes. They emphasize that constructive engagement can enhance well-being, while negative experiences can exacerbate mental health problems.

In addition, a reputable website, Mental Health America (2021), provides resources and insights on managing social media use to promote mental well-being. They recommend setting boundaries and being mindful of the content consumed to mitigate adverse effects.

Lastly, a book by Rosen et al. (2014) explores the psychological implications of technology use, including social media. The authors provide a comprehensive analysis of how digital interactions shape emotional health and suggest strategies for healthier engagement.
